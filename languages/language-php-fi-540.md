```PHP/FI is a light, and powerful, interpreter for server-parsed 
("dynamic" this year, SSH since NCSA invented the thing ages ago) 
html which can be used either as a CGI redirected processor or 
embbedded in Apache servers. Its web site is 
<a HREF="http://php.iquest.net/">http://php.iquest.net/</a>.
