```Haskell isn't fun unless you use monads.
Monads aren't fun unless you use monad transformers :)

import Control.Monad.State

-- new data type
data Beer = B Int

-- factorize code a little bit
tk = "Take one down and pass it around, "
wall = " of beer on the wall.\n"
end 1 =  tk++"1 bottle"++ wall
end n =  tk++show n++" bottles"++wall

-- define the way our brand new data type shows up 
instance Show Beer where
  show (B 0) = "No more bottle of beer on the wall, no more bottle of beer.\n"
         ++ "Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall."
  show (B 1) = "1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.\n"++end 0

-- This is not even a function, though it's recursive
-- Makes use of the IO monad over a State Int () monad
verse :: StateT Int IO ()

  cpt <- get
  liftIO $ print (B cpt)
  put (cpt-1)
  if (cpt >=1) then verse else return ()

-- I say "now" !
