```This may not qualify for your programming language
survey because there are only 2 or 3 pieces of
equipment in the world that would run it.

The IT (interface tester) was designed in 1986
to test our product's ability to respond to
serial control commands. IT's top speed is 
38.4 Kbaud (and on a 1 MHz processor, that was
considered fast!) IT's a Mot 6809 based thing.

Anyway, it has a sort of "shell" that is 
capable of some rudimentary loops and conditionals.
I no longer work at GPS (Graham-Patten Systems
http://www.gpsys.com ) but IT lives on and is 
still used today to test our products.

So, IT's programming language is over 15 years old.

This has to be all on one line. No \n's.
