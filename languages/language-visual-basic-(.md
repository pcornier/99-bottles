```Step 1: Create a New Console Application and then, add the following code in
the principal Module:

Module Bottles
    Sub Main()
    ' Visual Basic.NET version of 99 Bottles of beer (Bottles.vb)
    ' Fabrï¿½cio Costa, fabricio_costa@msn.com
        Dim Count As Int32
        For Count = 99 To 1 Step -1
            Console.WriteLine(Count & " bottle(s) of beer on the wall, " & Count & " bottle(s) of
beer.")
            Console.WriteLine("Take one down, pass it around, " & (Count - 1) & " bottle(s) of beer
on the wall.")
        Next
    End Sub
End Module```
