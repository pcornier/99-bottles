```This program is written in MEDITECH Magic.  This is NOT the same Magic 
as you have listed but was developed by Medical Information Technology 
in 1980 and is still in use.  

As MEDITECH is not only a large software company but on of the oldest, 
independent software companies in the world (est. 1969), I hope you 
consider this a valid language.  

As you can see, it is an extremely concise language and lots of fun to use.
