```dc is the Desk Calculator for *nix; It works on reverse polish 
notation, and a few other commands. The output of this routine 
is a little jagged, as dc has no commands to control screen formatting.

 Usage: dc 99bottles                                

 where this source file is saved as 99bottles       
 NB: A blank line is required at the end of the file
     Without it, dc will not quit.
