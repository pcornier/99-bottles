```Mission '99 bottles on the wall'

This is to be done immediately:

As security guard
paint bottles
and paint the wall as storage for bottles
and paint a random sentence as sentence
and set 99 as limitation for bottles on the wall

and as tax collector
collect 99 bottles on the wall

but as slot machine
count all bottles on the wall
and compare the result with 0
and obey the tax collector on success
but collect 'You won the jackpot' in a random sentence on failure

but as playwright
count all bottles on the wall

but as ghost
compare the result with 1
and follow the slot machine on success

but as playwright
rephrase a random sentence to ' bottles are standing on the wall,'
and count all bottles on the wall
and collect ' bottles of beer.' in a random sentence
and rephrase a random sentence to 'Take one down, pass it around,'

but as ghost
take 1 bottles from the wall

but as playwright
count all bottles on the wall
and collect ' bottles of beer on the wall.' in a random sentence

but as ghost
obey the slot machine on success

but as slot machine
collect 'You won the jackpot' in a random sentence

and as playwright
collect ' bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer.' in a random sentence
and collect 'Take one down and pass it around, no more bottles of beer on the wall.' in a random
sentence
and collect 'No more bottles of beer on the wall, no more bottles of beer.' in a random sentence
and collect 'Go to the store and buy some more, 99 bottles of beer on the wall.' in a random
sentence

and as ghost
collect 'Scary stuff!' in a random sentence
and return after having done so.```
